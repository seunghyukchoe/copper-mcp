[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A bounded, integer-only, single-layer A* reference that produces content-addressed immutable
  two-pin candidates for a narrow rectangular Board IR subset, with exact boundary semantics,
  deterministic tie-breaking, preparation/search cancellation, independent grid/expansion/obstacle
  work ceilings, typed diagnostics with deterministic counters, and fail-closed geometry and API
  handling. KiCad export, authoritative candidate DRC, MCP exposure, preview, and apply are deferred.
- A bounded benchmark-only Dijkstra oracle plus a reproducible synthetic harness that verifies A*
  completion and exact optimal-cost agreement while retaining the expected no-path fixture and raw
  deterministic, runtime, and incremental-memory evidence. This is not a KiCad DRC or throughput
  claim.
- Canonical Board IR `0.1.0` with integer nanometre/microdegree geometry, typed routing constraints,
  strict canonical JSON, semantic and snapshot digests, bounded decoding, and a versioned JSON Schema.
- A bounded, read-only, fail-closed KiCad converter for the documented rectangular-outline subset,
  plus golden valid/invalid JSON and synthetic source fixtures and explicit architecture/ADR
  documentation. This converter does not route, mutate, preview, or apply board changes.
- Explicit solid-zone priority, pad-connection, and island-removal intent in Board IR, plus a
  version-pinned KiCad semantic preflight for copper/`Edge.Cuts` graphics and supported object fields.

### Changed

- Ledger validation now rejects oversized, non-strict, or content-address mismatched benchmark JSON
  artifacts.
- CodeQL `init`, `analyze`, and SARIF upload now move as one pinned v4 suite, and Dependabot groups
  future CodeQL suite updates so incompatible action generations cannot be proposed separately.

### Fixed

- The tag-only publish job now passes its repository explicitly when creating a GitHub release, so
  it does not depend on a checkout in the isolated publish job.
- Board IR construction now normalizes direct content before hashing, aligns runtime/schema limits,
  restricts v0.1 to one hole-free outline and full-stack through vias, and keeps public writer output
  readable by default decoder budgets.

### Security

- KiCad and Board IR parsing now use quote-aware streaming S-expression tokens, a pre-DOM JSON
  lexical/structural budget pass, exact context-independent decimal conversion, bounded non-echoing
  diagnostics, and explicit rejection of unmodeled routing or non-default fabrication semantics.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Initial Apache-2.0 project foundation and governance.
- Secure, bounded inspection for `.kicad_pcb` files.
- Fixed-argument, read-only KiCad JSON DRC with bounded severity, connectivity, ignored-check, and
  violation-type summaries plus stale-context checks.
- Versioned board-manifest, DRC-summary, and candidate JSON schemas.
- MCP tools for server information, board inspection, KiCad DRC, candidate validation, and comparison.
- Correctness-first candidate ranking and routing backend contracts.
- GitHub issue forms, CI, CodeQL, dependency auditing, release automation, and project ledgers.
- A non-publishing release dry run that verifies the requested version, complete quality gate, and
  distribution artifacts before a version tag is created.
- A source-linked survey of open PCB autorouters and a modern CPU, multicore, exact-repair, GPU, and
  typed-ML research roadmap.
- Audio Board Lab #001, CopperTone: a separately licensed, board-first KiCad 10 stereo line-buffer
  preview with BOM, manufacturing exports, STEP model, renders, constraints, provenance, and a
  one-command read-only DRC and artifact-hash validation workflow plus explicit snapshot refresh.
- Public social-preview artwork and a factual KiCad development screenshot with provenance records.

### Fixed

- KiCad 10 named-net inspection now counts deduplicated item-level `(net "NAME")` declarations when
  legacy numeric top-level net declarations are absent.
- CopperTone uses stable semantic UUIDv5 identities and temporary default validation so unchanged
  board replays no longer replace native object identities or modify tracked files.

### Security

- GitHub Actions are pinned to reviewed immutable commits; the release workflow uses the current
  official attestation action and explicitly scoped artifact-metadata permission.
- Workspace confinement protects against parent-path and symlink escapes.
- Secret-bearing files, private boards, job stores, and generated artifacts are ignored by default.
- MCP network transport binds to loopback unless explicitly reconfigured.
- KiCad execution uses a validated executable, fixed arguments, discarded logs, a POSIX child-process
  file ceiling, cumulative byte/file-count and discovery-time bounds, non-overlapping snapshot
  lifetimes, timeouts, strict contract parsing, and before/after DRC-context revision checks.
- The development dependency floor excludes pytest versions affected by `PYSEC-2026-1845`.
