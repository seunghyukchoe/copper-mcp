# Development Guide

## Supported environment

- Python 3.11–3.13.
- Git 2.40 or newer recommended.
- KiCad is optional for unit tests. When `kicad-cli` is available, the authoritative DRC integration
  test runs against a temporary copy of the synthetic fixture.

Create a virtual environment and install all checks:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,security]"
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

## Validation levels

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `make test` | Fast dependency-light unit suite. |
| `make lint` | Ruff plus version and ledger structure. |
| `make typecheck` | Strict static typing. |
| `make security` | Secret and dependency audit. |
| `make build` | Wheel and source distribution. |
| `make check` | Full pre-release gate. |

Tests should not require network access or proprietary boards. GPU and KiCad integration tests must
be separately marked and have deterministic CPU or fixture-based coverage where practical.

On macOS, CopperMCP also checks the standard KiCad application path. Elsewhere, put `kicad-cli` on
`PATH` or set `COPPER_MCP_KICAD_CLI`. Do not add CLI argument passthrough: the DRC adapter's fixed
argument vector is a security boundary. The current bounded-execution helper requires a POSIX host;
unsupported platforms fail closed before starting KiCad.

DRC runs against a private mirror of the board's workspace-relative context. Keep project-local
symbol/footprint libraries and library tables below `COPPER_MCP_WORKSPACE`; external environment or
global-library dependencies may make DRC results host-dependent and must be declared in benchmark
provenance. Tune `COPPER_MCP_MAX_DRC_CONTEXT_BYTES` only after reviewing the workspace scope.
File-count and discovery-time ceilings are separately configurable through
`COPPER_MCP_MAX_DRC_CONTEXT_FILES` and `COPPER_MCP_MAX_DRC_CONTEXT_SCAN_SECONDS`.

## Adding a public contract

1. Open an RFC issue.
2. Write or update an ADR.
3. Add JSON Schema and valid/invalid fixtures.
4. Add compatibility tests.
5. Document migration and lifecycle expectations.
6. Update the decision ledger and changelog.

## Dependency policy

Runtime dependencies require a clear justification, active maintenance, compatible licence, and
security review. Standard-library solutions are preferred for small boundary functions. Lockfiles
will be introduced before the first release once the supported packaging workflow is finalized.
