# Development Guide

## Supported environment

- Python 3.11–3.13.
- Git 2.40 or newer recommended.
- KiCad is optional for the current read-only manifest tests and will become required for IPC and
  authoritative DRC integration tests.

Create a virtual environment and install all checks:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,security]"
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

## Validation levels

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `make test` | Fast dependency-light unit suite. |
| `make lint` | Ruff plus version and ledger structure. |
| `make typecheck` | Strict static typing. |
| `make security` | Secret and dependency audit. |
| `make build` | Wheel and source distribution. |
| `make check` | Full pre-release gate. |

Tests should not require network access or proprietary boards. GPU and KiCad integration tests must
be separately marked and have deterministic CPU or fixture-based coverage where practical.

## Adding a public contract

1. Open an RFC issue.
2. Write or update an ADR.
3. Add JSON Schema and valid/invalid fixtures.
4. Add compatibility tests.
5. Document migration and lifecycle expectations.
6. Update the decision ledger and changelog.

## Dependency policy

Runtime dependencies require a clear justification, active maintenance, compatible licence, and
security review. Standard-library solutions are preferred for small boundary functions. Lockfiles
will be introduced before the first release once the supported packaging workflow is finalized.
