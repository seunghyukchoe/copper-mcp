# Deterministic A* Routing Baseline

## Status

`routing/astar.py` is a candidate-only CPU reference for one exact two-pin route. The separate
`adapters/kicad_route_patch.py` bridge can now serialize that exact replayed candidate into a
disposable KiCad board, and the internal KiCad service can bind that private derivative to
authoritative DRC evidence. A bounded, non-mutating preview now exposes that pipeline through MCP
and the CLI. The slice remains smaller than issue #10's complete acceptance target: it does not
route multiple nets, run durable jobs, persist or export candidate boards, or apply copper.

## Accepted input

| Surface | First-slice contract |
|---|---|
| Snapshot | Canonical, digest-verified Board IR `0.1.0` |
| Request | One stable net ID, one stable signal-layer ID, exact base revision, seed, integer settings |
| Connectivity | Exactly two pads belonging to the net; both accessible on the selected layer |
| Constraints | One net-class width/clearance assignment; no selected-net length or differential-pair rule |
| Board | One hole-free, axis-aligned rectangular outline |
| Obstacles | Rectangular track keepouts, plus foreign-net pads and orthogonal segments on the selected layer |
| Existing geometry | No vias, selected-layer arcs or zones, off-axis pads, diagonal segments, or copper already on the routed net |
| Search | Four-neighbour orthogonal grid; east, north, west, south expansion order |
| Output | Immutable orthogonal `RoutePatch` tied to the unchanged snapshot digest |

Anything outside this matrix returns a typed diagnostic. Unsupported objects and selected-net
constraints are never silently ignored.

## Exact geometry

All coordinates, costs, widths, clearances, and penalties are integers in nanometres. The lattice is
anchored at the lexicographically first pad ID; the other pad-center delta must be exactly divisible
by `grid_step_nm`.

The board is inset by the ceiling of half the route width. Track keepouts are expanded by that
half-width plus the selected net-class clearance. A centerline on the resulting boundary is legal;
entering its open interior by one nanometre is not. Every complete grid edge is checked, not only its
endpoints. These semantics are covered by exact-boundary and one-nanometre regression tests.

Selected-layer copper outside the routed net is an obstacle rather than a rejection. A foreign pad
contributes a rectangle centred on the pad, with its sizes swapped on a quarter turn; an orthogonal
segment contributes the rectangle its centreline sweeps, grown by the ceiling of half its width.
Each is inflated by the routed half-width plus the stricter of the routed net's and the obstacle
net's class clearance, so a board mixing net classes cannot be routed to the looser rule.

Round pad shapes use their bounding box. That over-approximates only: it can refuse a route a
rounder shape would allow, never permit a clearance violation. Arcs, zones, vias, off-axis pad
rotations, diagonal segments, and a net that is already partially routed still fail closed, because
a rectangle cannot represent them without lying. Every obstacle counts against `max_obstacles`.

## Objective and determinism

The primary scalar objective is:

```text
total_cost_nm = wire_length_nm
              + bend_count * bend_penalty_nm
              + proximity_steps * proximity_penalty_nm
```

The Manhattan heuristic omits non-negative penalties and remains admissible. Search state includes
incoming direction so bend cost is exact. Equal-cost states use stable integer tuple ordering; no
wall clock, hash randomization, process memory, or floating-point value participates. The seed is
recorded in candidate identity for parity with future policies but does not randomize this baseline.

`max_grid_nodes` bounds the position lattice before allocation, `max_expansions` bounds state search,
`max_obstacles` caps selected-layer obstacles, and `max_obstacle_checks` directly bounds the otherwise
multiplicative edge/proximity work. Cancellation is checked during preparation, between expansions,
and at most every 64 obstacle checks during a long evaluation. Node-budget, obstacle-budget,
search-budget, cancellation, unsupported constraint, unsupported geometry, stale revision, invalid
snapshot/request, off-grid endpoint, and no-path outcomes remain distinct. Failure diagnostics carry
deterministic expanded-state and obstacle-check counts.

## Benchmark oracle

`routing/oracle.py` provides a benchmark-only Dijkstra oracle that sets the heuristic to zero while
reusing the exact bounded preparation, edge-legality, proximity, and additive-cost evaluators. It
returns only an optimal cost or typed diagnostic—never a route patch—and is intentionally excluded
from the supported routing API. Tests compare A* and Dijkstra completion, total cost, bends, and
proximity steps on straight, detour, exact-clearance, and no-path cases.

`scripts/benchmark_routing.py` repeats those generated fixtures, verifies deterministic outcomes,
and emits content-addressed JSON with raw timing and incremental-memory samples. The tiny synthetic
suite is an optimality and reproducibility check, not evidence of whole-board quality, production
throughput, KiCad DRC, or superiority over another router.

## Candidate identity

The route is compressed to omit collinear interior points and post-validated against the same exact
board and obstacle bounds. Canonical JSON identity bytes contain:

- base revision and endpoint pad IDs;
- net, layer, width, and integer vertices;
- exact cost decomposition and deterministic search metrics;
- router version, policy, seed, and all A* settings, including every resource ceiling.

The circular `candidate_id` field is excluded from those bytes, then set to their SHA-256 digest.
`verify_candidate_id()` rechecks that binding. Runtime and memory measurements do not affect the ID.

## Disposable KiCad bridge

`render_kicad_candidate_board()` first reproduces the supplied Board IR from the original KiCad bytes
and constraint profile. It verifies candidate identity, reruns the bounded A* request, and requires an
exact candidate match. Every modeled source geometry object must have a native UUID/tstamp; the
bridge rejects revision-derived geometry IDs because rewriting derivative metadata would otherwise
change them. Each compressed route edge becomes one root-level KiCad segment with exact decimal
units and a deterministic UUIDv5 derived from candidate identity and edge order. Native UUID/tstamp
identities are collected once for constant-time collision checks, and the derivative records
`copper-mcp` plus its package version as its KiCad writer.

The rendered bytes stay under the same parser, byte, and total-object budgets and are parsed back
through the supported KiCad adapter. The complete modeled content must equal the base snapshot after
replacing only source revision and writer provenance and appending the expected segments. The
function performs no file write, durable export, subprocess call, preview, MCP action, or board
mutation. DRC orchestration remains a separate adapter boundary.

## Candidate-bound authoritative DRC

`run_route_candidate_drc()` captures the source board and its bounded project/rule/library context
before parsing. It builds the Board IR snapshot only from those captured bytes and invokes only the
replay-verified serializer above. The patched board replaces the original board payload in memory;
the adapter rechecks the per-file, file-count, and cumulative context budgets before writing a
path-preserving private temporary snapshot.

Candidate DRC and ordinary board DRC use the same fixed KiCad argument vector, POSIX file ceiling,
timeout, discarded output, accepted result codes, bounded report reader, and strict JSON parser. The
complete private board/rule/library input context is recaptured and hashed after the subprocess
exits. A final recapture of the original board, rules, and workspace-local libraries must match the
initial context revision or the evidence is discarded.

The frozen evidence record binds the candidate ID, its Board IR base revision, original KiCad source
revision, patched board revision, complete patched context revision, and nested aggregate
`DrcSummary`. The summary's base and context revisions must match the patched revisions, its
violation-type total must equal its aggregate finding counts, and KiCad exit code `0` or `5` must
agree with the absence or presence of report findings. Exit code `5` is valid evidence rather than
an adapter failure; warning-only or exclusion-only evidence may still have a hard-pass flag. No
candidate bytes, raw descriptions, coordinates, UUIDs, or net names are returned. A KiCad 10.0.5
integration test runs this path from the original synthetic two-pad fixture and verifies that source
bytes, inode, modification time, and workspace entries remain unchanged.

## Public non-mutating preview

`route_preview.preview_route()` is the first public routing surface, exposed as the `preview_route`
MCP tool and the `copper-mcp preview-route` command. It parses one untrusted request, resolves a
single `.kicad_pcb` beneath the workspace, converts it through the fail-closed Board IR adapter,
proposes one candidate, and optionally binds ADR-0008 DRC evidence.

Requests carry a workspace-relative board path, a KiCad net name, a copper layer name, integer
net-class constraints, and optional seed, A* settings, and `include_drc` fields. Unknown fields,
non-integer or out-of-range budgets, booleans supplied as integers, control characters, oversized
net names, and non-copper layer names are rejected before any file is read. Routing constraints come
only from the caller, never from untrusted board content, so a board file cannot widen its own
clearance.

Every outcome is one of three statuses. `routed` carries a candidate whose base revision must equal
the previewed Board IR snapshot digest. `not_routed` carries exactly one typed, non-echoing
diagnostic. `unsupported_board` carries bounded conversion diagnostic-code counts and no snapshot
digest; any conversion diagnostic, including a warning, produces this status. A wall-clock deadline
(`COPPER_MCP_MAX_ROUTE_PREVIEW_SECONDS`, default 30 s) starts at the operation boundary, before the
board is resolved, read, or converted, and bounds the whole call rather than only the search. It is
checked after conversion, consulted during search, and clamps the KiCad timeout for optional DRC to
whatever budget remains. Exceeding it surfaces as the ordinary `cancelled` diagnostic, and it never
participates in candidate identity.

`include_drc` runs the candidate-bound authoritative path and returns the same aggregate, redacted
`DrcSummary` plus the candidate, source, patched-board, and patched-context revisions. A missing
KiCad CLI or non-binding evidence fails the whole call rather than returning an unverified
candidate. `RoutePreview` revalidates all of these bindings on construction and serializes to a
detached plain dictionary.

The preview writes no file, creates no job, persists nothing, and applies no copper. It does return
the integer geometry and endpoint pad IDs it generated, which is an intentional and documented
disclosure; source board bytes and unrelated board objects are never returned.

## Safety boundary

Zero `hard_internal_violations` means only that this implementation's supported-grid post-checks
passed. Successful serialization alone is not a KiCad DRC result. Candidate-bound DRC evidence
applies to one private replayed derivative plus its recorded context; it is not a durable candidate
file, a whole-board routing result, or production approval. A preview is a proposal, not an applied
route.
It says nothing about electrical behavior, SI/PI, EMC, thermal performance, DFM, fabrication
readiness, or hardware safety. Preview, persistence, and application require separate contracts.

A committed `blocked-pad.kicad_pcb` fixture places a 2 mm x 8 mm foreign-net pad between the two
endpoints. The router detours around it, and a KiCad 10.0.5 integration test asserts the resulting
board reports zero DRC errors and zero unconnected items, so the obstacle model is checked against
the authoritative tool rather than only against itself.
